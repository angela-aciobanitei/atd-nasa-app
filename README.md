## Android Techdegree Treehouse Project 12: NASA App

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build an Android app stemming from the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). The app must have a landing screen and two main areas. You may choose two of the three options listed below. 

*   Rover Postcard Maker:
Access the Mars Rover Imagery API and display an image from the Mars Rover. The image can be user selected or random. 

*   Eye-In-the-Sky:
You will build a tool to access the Earth Imagery API. Users should be able to, at a minimum, query the most recent photo of a particular location on earth. In addition, you may not simply enter latitude and longitudes manually, but must input location information based on an interactive map, address form, OR an API, such as Foursquare.

*   Third option:
You can absolutely create your own app feature, like APOD (The Astronomy Picture of the Day), or InSight (Mars Weather Service API), but you must make use of the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). 

Note: The app MUST make use of RecyclerViews, Animation, Unit Testing, and Error Handling.
